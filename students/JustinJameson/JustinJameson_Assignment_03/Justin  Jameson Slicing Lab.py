#Title: Justin Jameson Slicing Lab.py
#Desc: Write some functions that take a sequence as an argument, and return a copy of that sequence:
# with the first and last items exchanged.
# with every other item removed.
# with the first 4 and the last 4 items removed, and then every other item in the remaining sequence.
# with the elements reversed (just with slicing).
# with the last third, then first third, then the middle third in the new order.
# NOTE: These should work with ANY sequence â€“ but you can use strings to test, if you like.
#   Sequence: an ordered collection of objects.
#   Object: an encapsulation of variables and functions into a single entity
